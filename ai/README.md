# AI-Based Early Outbreak Detection System

## Project Overview
The project aims to detect infectious disease outbreaks using Rolling Statistics, EWMA (Exponentially Weighted Moving Average), Rolling Z-score Anomaly Detection, Risk Scoring, Spatial Hotspot Detection, and an Interactive Dashboard.

## Installation Instructions

This project uses the system Python environment (no virtual environment is required).

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd outbreak_detection_system
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Planned Pipeline
1. **Data Preparation & Time Series Construction**: Loading, cleaning, validating, and aggregating data.
2. **Anomaly Detection**: Applying rolling statistics, EWMA, and Z-scores to identify temporal anomalies.
3. **Spatial Analysis**: Identifying geographical hotspots.
4. **Risk Scoring**: Evaluating the severity of detected anomalies.
5. **Visualization**: Presenting findings in an interactive dashboard.

## Future Roadmap
- Integration with real-time data feeds.
- Advanced machine learning models for outbreak forecasting.
- Automated alert generation and distribution.
